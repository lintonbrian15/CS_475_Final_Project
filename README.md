# CS_475_Final_Project

General Idea: Train and develop model on the sentiments datasets, to create a model that is able to read a sentence and tell if it is positive (1) or negative (0) in sentiment. Next, we will give the model amazon reviews as input, parse them into individual sentences, and give each sentence a (1) or (0). The review will then be given an overall 'positiveity score' which is the ratio of positive sentences to total sentences. This will be used to determine the 'accuracy' of star reviews; sometimes people will give a 5-star review but the actual text of the review is negative. This is misleading for people trying to get a sense of whether they would like to buy a product; our model will evaluate reviews and assign them a new star rating based on the 'positiveity score' of the review. For example, a 5-star review will 3/5 positive sentences will be reassigned a score of 3-stars. [Positiveity Score Scale: 1 star (0.00-0.19) 2 stars (0.20-0.39) 3 stars (0.40-0.59) 4 stars (0.60-0.79) 5 stars (0.80-1.00)]
